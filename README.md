Photo app _**"The Place"**_.
Here is two part of the project: _backend_ (express.js, MongoDB) and _frontend_ (React JS).

You can add and share your pictures. Look and like pictures of others.  
You can't see any profiles except yours, only photos that people have shared.
So everyone will evaluate the photos with an open mind and see the result on their page.
